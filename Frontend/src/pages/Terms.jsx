      The order cut-off time for Next Day Delivery is 2:30 pm in the delivery location on the day prior to

      Please note that there are some remote locations that cannot be guaranteed for Next Day 
      Delivery. We will notify you at point of your purchase (if this is during normal business hours) if

      not guarantee) to deliver at the requested time.</p> <br/>

      <h5>Delivery Instructions </h5>
      <p>Our couriers do not call prior to delivery. Please ensure the recipient is home to receive items.
      If no person is present to accept the order at the location specified, our driver will act at their 
      discretion based on weather conditions, safety, security, etc.
      Where a secure location is not available, our couriers will leave a note advising the recipient to 
      contact Floral Fusion Service to arrange for re-delivery. We will charge you $17.95 for the cost of 
      re-delivery, but will contract you for authorization prior to charging this fee.
      If you provide us with an incorrect delivery address, you must pay $10 for re-delivery of your 
      order to the correct address. We may also charge you for the cost of new flowers if we need to 
      replace the original flowers. </p> <br/>
